# AI-Konane-Game
A two-player strategy board game which is played on a rectangular board. It begins with black and white counters filling the board in an alternating pattern. 
Players then hop over one another's pieces, capturing them similar to checkers. The first player unable to capture is the loser; their opponent is the winner.
